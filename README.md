# Manchester Orchestra Hangman

# Overview #
This is a Manchester Orchestra themed web based Hangman game. This game features one song from each of Manchester Orchestras studio albums to guess the names of. When you guess a song name correctly then the song will play and it will show the album artwork of the album the song is from. Make sure to turn up your volume to enjoy those sweet sweet tunes. 

# Instructions # 
Game play is pretty easy, just use your keyboard to guess letters! Some keys are not applicable keys and will not be logged if pressed. The only keys that are able to be used are the letter keys for guessing, and dont worry about case sensitivity for the song names to be guessed everything will be lowercase. 

# Future Development #
Right now there are only five songs in the word guess list. I am looking forward to adding their entire songlist from every album as well as singles and featured on songs to the game as well. 

Also right now the only band featured is obviously Manchester Orchestra but I would love to add an option to play a hangman game based on each of the bands signed to Favorite Gentleman.
